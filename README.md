Hi everyone! My name is Chrissie Faenza and I'm from Millburn, New Jersey. I'm currently a rising junior at Lehigh University in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where I'm studying Journalism, with double minors in Marketing and Business. 

On campus, I write for Lehigh's student publication, the Brown and White, where I am an Associate Editor. I am also an executive council member of my sorority, Alpha Gamma Delta, where I serve as the Director of Property.
